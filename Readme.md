#### path_to_directory - can be relative or absolute path to directory
#### path_to_new_directory - path to directory
#### path_to_file & path_to_destination - path to file + name file
#### new_file_name & new_filename - name file

#### all console command without "" or ''
#### it's right: compress C:\Users\Home\java.txt C:\Users\Home\java.br
#### it's wrong: compress "C:\Users\Home\java.txt" "C:\Users\Home\java.br" or 'C:\Users\Home\java.txt' 'C:\Users\Home\java.br'

#### console command: up, cd path_to_directory, ls, cat path_to_file, add new_file_name, rn path_to_file new_filename,
#### cp path_to_file path_to_new_directory, mv path_to_file path_to_new_directory, rm path_to_file, rm path_to_file,
#### os --cpus, os --homedir, os --username, os --architecture, hash path_to_file, compress path_to_file path_to_destination,
#### decompress path_to_file path_to_destination
